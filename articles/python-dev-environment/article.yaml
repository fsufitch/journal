title: Filip’s Awesome (Totally-Not-Overcomplicated) Python Dev Environment
blurb: |
       "What’s the best way to structure my Python dev environment? 
       How do you install Python, and which version (and how do you switch versions)? 
       How do you install and manage dependencies? 
       What’s the best way to use virtualenvs (and what are they)?" Well... I'm glad you asked.
