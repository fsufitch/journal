Okay, they're not technically famous (yet). I couldn't resist the alliteration, though.

My whole life, french fries have been one of my staple comfort foods. 
Crunchy outside, chewy inside, and uncomplicated salty taste... Delicious! It always
seemed easier said than done, though. I've been eperimenting with ways to cook them
for years, but so many ways just come out wrong: soggy, too-charred, dry, or any number 
of other failings. Not are those just not that good, but they're also unhealthy.

Ultimately, I have figured out a technique that _works_ and achieves _consistent results_.
I've experimented with simplifying it, and it's at a point where it's straightforward
and repeatable enough that I can make any amount for any purpose, be it a side for a
bigger dish, or just a snack bowl in and of itself.

Without further ado, let's get into it.

# Recipe

**Servings:** 4 (as a side), 2-3 (as a main)

**Timing:**

* **Mise en place**: 10-15 minutes
* **Waiting**: 15-20 minutes
* **Cooking**: 15 minutes (more if doing multiple batches)
* __**Total**__: 45-55 minuts


::: alert info
**Equipment note:** This recipe involves deep frying in a stock pot. You will need
a large stock pot, a strainer spoon, and an oil splash guard. An infrared thermometer
is also very helpful, though not strictly necessary.

If you have a real deep fryer, that's even better, but I have not used one, so
the details for adapting this recipe for a deep fryer are not included.

## Ingredients

* 4 Russet potatoes
* 2 gallons (7-8 L) of peanut oil, or enough to fill your stock pot by about half
  * This is a large amount of oil, but any that is left over is reuseable; the actual _consumed_ amount is very low
* Salt, pepper
* Your choice of seasoning (recommended: [Dash Garlic and Herb](https://mrsdash.com/product/garlic-herb-seasoning-blend/))

## Directions

1. Wash your potatoes well. Do _not_ peel them.

2. Cut your potatoes into wedges, length-wise. You should have about 10-12 wedges per typical Russet potato.
  
   > My recommendation: cut the potato in half, then stand each half gently up and cut wedge slices off of it 
   > which are 1/3 to 1/2 inch (or, 1 cm) at their thickest.

3. Place the potato wedges in a large bowl of ice-cold water. If you can, add a bunch of ice cubes on top as well.
   Let them sit and chill, at least 15 minutes.

4. In the meantime, pour all the oil into your stock pot. Put it on your stove on medium or medium-high heat.
   Heat it to 350-375 째F (175-190 째C). 

   > If you do not have a thermometer, you can tell when you get close to the temperature by using your hand to sprinkle
   a couple drops of cold water into the pot. The right temperature is when the droplets sink to the bottom
   of the pot, and make loud "popping" noises that sound the pot like a bell. 

:::alert warning
**Safety notes:**

* Always keep the splash guard on your stock pot when you are not actively handling its contents.

* Do *not* let the oil get above 400 째F or 200 째C. It will become a safety hazard,
and your potatoes will come out burnt.

* Water/ice + hot oil = lots of steam. When putting potatoes in, make sure they are minimally wet.
Drip-dry them wish your strainer spoon, or get bonus points for patting them dry with paper towels.

* **No splashing!** Be gentle when maneuvering around hot oil.

5. When your oil is close to the correct temperature, drain all water and ice from the bowl of potatoes. 
   Optionally, rinse them with fresh water and also pat them dry with paper towels.

6. Gently place the potatoes in the hot oil using your strainer spoon. Turn the heat up to medium-high.

   > Overcrowding the potatoes risks sticking, dropping oil temperature too much (meaning soggy fries), and
   making a mess. Split them up into multiple batches if you have to.

:::

1. Let them cook for 10-12 minutes. Stir and nudge the potatoes around the pot every couple minutes or so,
   to make sure they do not stick to each other, or to the pot.

2. Cook until done. Some signs to look out for:
   - They "ballooned" full of steam, and are floating.
   - They have a golden color, with a few touches of brown.
   - When you pick them up with the strainer spoon and rattle them around, they make dry, hollow sounds
     (as if they were peanuts or similar)

3. Line a bowl with paper towels. Gently remove the potatoes from the pot and place them in the bowl.

4.  Season __immediately__ with salt, pepper, and your spice mix. Toss the potatoes around to get an
    even coating. 

5.  Serve and enjoy your crunchy pouches of soft fluffy deliciousness!

# Some final thoughts...

### Why is the pre-fry ice bath so important?

The water rinses starch off the surface of the potatoes. Starch is what makes a potato "fluffy", and
Russets have a lot of it (which is why they are also great as baked potatoes). However, starch prevents
crunchiness, so for the surface of the fries to get crunchy, it must have its starch removed.

Additionally, the cold temperature _also_ helps the crunch. When potatoes go into the oil, their surface 
experiences "heat shock", cooking very quickly while the oil similarly cools very quickly. This is
especially effective when the potato is very cold. The end effect is that the surface of your fries becomes
a hard crunchy impermeable "pouch" which serves two purposes:

1. It keeps the oil *out*. Letting more oil into the fries makes them soggy and limp, and less healthy to eat.
2. It keeps the steam *in*. The potato flesh inside the fry "bakes" in its own water, becoming a fluffy filling.
   This is why the fries "puff up" as they do.

Lastly, when potatoes are cut and exposed to air, their inner flesh oxidizes (aka rusts). It turns brown and
gross-looking. It's still perfectly edible and tasty, but who wants gross brown fries? Water protects the 
potato from air, keeping it looking fresh-cut while it waits in the sidelines (in addition to serving the
other purposes from above).

### Why not double-fry?

I have also had some success with double-frying, but it is a more complicated, multi-step recipe. This
single-fry version is less complex, and comes out just as good (if not better). 

### Why the wedge shape?

In my experiments with different shapes/methods, wedges worked best with this recipe. "Stick" fries do
not seem to like the "puffing up" part of this recipe&mdash;they puncture, let oil into the fry and
become soggy. Using a double-fry method works better for stick fries.

### Recipe inspiration

This recipe is an iterative product, but credit for the final validation and tweaks to how I do it
goes to Christine Ha and her book "[Recipes from My Home Kitchen: Asian and American Comfort Food](https://isbnsearch.org/isbn/9781623360948)".
I highly recommend it as a source of great information on top-notch home cooking.

I hope you enjoyed this little write-up... and the fries themselves, of course. Until next time!
