Welcome to my new blog! Journal! Thingy!

I used to (and technically still do) have a blog [on Medium](https://medium.com/@fsufitch). 
However, it was not as good of a platform for my style of writing as I thought. Since I was
reimplementing my website anyway, I decided to move to a custom made blog.

```python
print("Hello blog world!")
```

That's all there really is to say here. More details on the whys and hows are coming later.
In the meantime, I will be republishing articles from my old blog here, so keep an eye 
on the [main page](/journal)!

Welcome!
